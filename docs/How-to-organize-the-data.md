Here we will present how data for different experiment methods are about to be stored

# White beam techniques

## Radiography

## Tomography

## Time-series 

## Multi-modal radiography

## Multi-modal Tomography

## Neutron grating interferometry 
It is a matter of discussion how to categorize this one.

## Polarized neutron imaging

# Wavelength resolved techniques
