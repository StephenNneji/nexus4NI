Here we will present how data for different experiment methods are about to be stored

# White beam techniques

## Radiography (__Jean__)

## Tomography (__Anders__, Jean)

## Multi-modal radiography (__Alessandro__, Anders)

## Multi-modal Tomography (Alessandro, __Anders__)

## Neutron grating interferometry (Simon/Matteo)
It is a matter of discussion how to categorize this one.

## Polarized neutron imaging (__Anders__/Alessandro/Soren)

# Wavelength resolved techniques 

## Diffraction based (__Soren__)

## Resonance (__Anna__, Alex)
