Here we will present how data for different experiment methods are about to be stored

# White beam techniques

## Radiography (**Jean**)

## Tomography (**Anders**, Jean)

## Multi-modal radiography (**Alessandro**, Anders)

## Multi-modal Tomography (Alessandro, **Anders**)

## Neutron grating interferometry (Simon/Matteo)
It is a matter of discussion how to categorize this one.

## Polarized neutron imaging (**Anders**/Alessandro/Soren)

# Wavelength resolved techniques 

## Diffraction based (**Soren**)

## Resonance (**Anna**, Alex)
